2.  What is a W3C?  


W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium.

It is the main international organization that develops standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web.

In simple words:
W3C makes the rules of how the web should work, so that all websites and browsers follow the same standards and everything works smoothly.

About W3C :

Founded: 1994

Founder: Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web 🌍).

Goal: To ensure the Web grows in a way that is open, accessible, and consistent for everyone.

What W3C Does :

Defines Web Standards → For HTML, CSS, XML, SVG, Web APIs, etc.

Ensures Compatibility → So a website works the same on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
