5.  What is SDLC life cycle? 

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a step-by-step process used by software companies to plan, design, develop, test, and deliver software (applications, websites, systems).

In simple words:
SDLC is like a blueprint/roadmap that tells developers how to build software in an organized way.

Phases of SDLC (Life Cycle) :

Requirement Analysis :

Collect requirements from clients or users.

Example: A client wants an e-commerce website with login, product catalog, and payment gateway.

Planning & Feasibility Study 

Decide budget, timeline, and resources.

Check if the project is technically and financially possible.

System Design :

Create architecture, database design, and UI/UX mockups.

Decide technologies (like Java, React, MySQL).

Implementation (Development) :

Developers write code according to design.

Frontend + Backend + Database are developed.

Testing :

Test the software for bugs, errors, and security issues.

Ensure it works as expected.

Deployment :

Release software to users (launch the app/website).

Sometimes first deployed to a smaller group (beta testing).

Maintenance 

Fix bugs, release updates, add new features.

Keep the software running smoothly.

SDLC Models :

There are different ways to follow the SDLC steps:

Waterfall Model → Each phase step by step, no going back.

Agile Model → Work in small parts (sprints), flexible.

Iterative Model → Build a basic version, improve in cycles.

V-Model → Testing happens alongside development.

Spiral Model → Combines iterative + risk analysis.

 In Short :
 
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process that ensures software is:
✔ Well-planned
✔ Well-designed
✔ Properly tested
✔ Delivered on time
✔ Easy to maintain
