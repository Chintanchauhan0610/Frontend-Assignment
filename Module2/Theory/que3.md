3.  What is Domain?

A Domain (or Domain Name) is the human-friendly address used to identify a website on the internet.

Instead of typing an IP address (like 142.250.182.206), we use a domain name (like google.com) which is easier to remember.

Parts of a Domain :

Example: www.example.com

www → Subdomain (optional)

example → Second-Level Domain (unique name chosen)

.com → Top-Level Domain (TLD, like .com, .org, .net, .in)

How a Domain Works :

You type a domain (e.g., www.example.com) in your browser.

The browser asks the DNS (Domain Name System) to translate it into an IP address.

The IP address points to the hosting server where the website files are stored.

The browser fetches the website from the server and displays it to you.

In Short  :

A Domain is like the street address of a website on the internet.

Domain = Address (example.com)

Hosting = The house where the website files live

Website = The content inside the house
