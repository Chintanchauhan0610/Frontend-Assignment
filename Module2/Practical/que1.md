1.  Explain phases of SDLC life cycle.

Phases of SDLC :

1. Requirement Analysis 

Collect requirements from clients, stakeholders, or end-users.

Understand what the software should do.

Example: Client wants an online shopping website with login, product catalog, cart, and payment gateway.

Deliverable: Requirement Specification Document (SRS).

2. Planning & Feasibility Study :

Plan the project’s time, cost, and resources.

Analyze if the project is technically possible (technology available?) and economically feasible (within budget?).

Example: Decide whether to build in React + Node.js + MySQL or another stack.

Deliverable: Feasibility Report, Project Plan.

3. System Design 

Convert requirements into a blueprint for developers.

High-Level Design (HLD): System architecture, database design, modules.

Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design for each module, UI/UX mockups.

Example: Designing database tables for users, products, and orders.

Deliverable: Design Documents, Wireframes, Database Schema.

4. Implementation (Development / Coding) :

Developers write actual code based on the design.

Frontend developers build the user interface.

Backend developers build the server & database logic.

Example: Coding the login system, product listing, and checkout process.

Deliverable: Working Software Modules (Code).

5. Testing :

Test the software to find and fix bugs.

Types of testing:

Unit Testing → Testing individual components.

Integration Testing → Checking if modules work together.

System Testing → Whole system works as expected.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) → Tested by end-users.

Example: Testing if payment works correctly and securely.

Deliverable: Test Report, Bug Fixes.

6. Deployment :

Software is released for actual use.

Deployment can be:

Staged Rollout → First to small group (beta).

Full Rollout → Released to all users.

Example: Launching the e-commerce website for all customers.

Deliverable: Live Working Application.

7. Maintenance :

After launch, continuous support is required.

Fixing new bugs, updating features, applying security patches.

Example: Adding new payment methods or fixing speed issues.

Deliverable: Updated Versions, Patches.
