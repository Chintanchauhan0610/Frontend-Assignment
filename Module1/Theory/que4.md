Hosting (or Web Hosting) is a service that provides space on a server where a website’s files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, databases, etc.) are stored and made accessible on the internet.

In simple words:
Hosting is like renting space on the internet for your website, so people can visit it anytime by typing your domain name.

How Hosting Works

You build a website (HTML, CSS, JS files, images, etc.).

You upload those files to a hosting server.

The server is always connected to the internet.

When someone types your domain name (e.g., www.example.com), the DNS finds your hosting server.

The hosting server sends the website files to the user’s browser.

The browser renders and displays the website.

Types of Hosting :

Shared Hosting

Many websites share one server.

Cheaper, but slower.

Good for beginners.

VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting

One physical server is divided into virtual servers.

Faster, more control than shared.

Dedicated Hosting

You get an entire server just for your website.

High performance, expensive.

Cloud Hosting

Your website is hosted on multiple connected servers (the “cloud”).

Scalable, reliable, widely used today.

Managed Hosting

Hosting provider manages updates, backups, security for you.

In Short

Domain Name = your website’s street address.

Hosting = the actual house where your website files live.

Website = the furniture & content inside the house.
