HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

It is the communication protocol used on the web that allows data to be transferred between a client (like a web browser) and a server (where websites and resources are hosted).

Key Points about HTTP:

Protocol → It defines a set of rules for how requests and responses are structured and transmitted.

Client-Server Model :

The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., when you type a URL or click a link).

The server processes it and sends back an HTTP response (e.g., HTML page, image, or JSON data).

Stateless → Each request is independent; the server does not remember previous interactions (unless something like cookies, sessions, or tokens is used).

Default Port → HTTP uses port 80, while the secure version (HTTPS) uses port 443.

Versions :

HTTP/1.1 – most widely used.

HTTP/2 – faster, supports multiplexing.

HTTP/3 – newest, based on QUIC protocol.

Methods (Verbs) → Common ones include:

GET → Request data from server.

POST → Send data to server (e.g., form submission).

PUT → Update data on server.

DELETE → Remove data from server.
