A Domain Name is the human-readable address of a website that you type into a browser to visit a site.

Example:

www.google.com

www.wikipedia.org

www.facebook.com

instead of remembering a long IP address (like 142.250.182.206), we use a domain name that is easy to read and remember.

Parts of a Domain Name :

Take www.example.com as an example:

www → Subdomain (can be optional, e.g., example.com works too).

example → Second-Level Domain (the unique name chosen).

.com → Top-Level Domain (TLD, like .com, .org, .net, .in).

How Domain Names Work :

You type www.example.com in your browser.

The browser sends a request to the DNS (Domain Name System).

DNS translates the domain name into an IP address (like 93.184.216.34).

The browser uses that IP to connect to the correct web server.

The server sends back the website files, and the browser displays the page.

In Short:

A domain name is like the address of your house on the internet.

The IP address is the house’s GPS coordinates (hard to remember).

The domain name is the easy street name (simple to remember).
